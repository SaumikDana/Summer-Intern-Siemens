# Summer-Intern-Siemens
This is the Python code I developed for the summer internship at Siemens Corporate Technology, Princeton, NJ, USA.
The code benchmark.py solves the heat conduction equation for an additive manufacturing microslice in the presence of a 
line source in the form of a toolpath. The code homogenized.py solves the reduced order model of the heat conduction equation. 
The reduced order model is derived analytically using the theory of two-scale asymptotic homogenization.
